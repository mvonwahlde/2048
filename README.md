# 2048 (Not yet finished)
2048 (played in the terminal) coded in C++ by Matthew VonWahlde

This is still a work in progress. The main game is programmed, but there are still some tasks to finish. School has been keeping me busy.

To Do:
- Better printing to console (consider GUI)
- Testing
- Score
- Comment code
- Sliding tiles algorithm improved
    - Instead of using matrix movement algorithms, I can just make arrays to enter into my tile sliding algorithm
